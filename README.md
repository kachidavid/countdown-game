# countdown-game
- this is a text-based game for a user against the computer.
- there is a total  number of 21 coins, the main goal is to subtract random numbers from (1-3). whoever gets to zero first wins
- i also implemented a secret strategy - included a code that uses the modular operator to always give out multiples of 4 - for the computer to always win if the human doesn't play perfectly.
